# mcstatic

a few scripts to build a static version of Midnight Commander [4.8.33] and pack it into AppImage.

## Motivation

I wanted **mc** to be available on Steam Deck.


## Setup

- I used Docker on Win11 through WSL2 to build.
- The rest is done by the scripts.
- After the build finishes, you will have an AppImage file in the build dir.

## Misc

Originally forked from https://github.com/gavriva/mcstatic but then transformed and updated completely.
